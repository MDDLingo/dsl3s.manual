Model-Driven Development is a generic designation for several tools and methodologies used to
thoroughly include modelling in software engineering. It requires a fundamental shift in the way software engineers use models, evolving from _ad hoc_ complementary documents to the main focus of their work, relegating coding to the background. 

MDD introduces a second and higher level of abstraction to modelling, by requiring in first place the formal capture of domain concepts in a meta-model. Software development becomes a process where instances of these meta-concepts are combined. Model-to-code transformations can then be applied to models complying to a specific meta-model.

With MDD source code becomes a sub-product of the development process, where the focus is on what the system must do, instead of how it does it.



Advantages
------------------

<b>User-definable mappings</b> - domain specific concepts are captured at an ontological level, producing a lexicon of model constructs (a domain specific language) that are independent of any code language or software platforms.

<b>Understandability</b> - MDD relies on graphical constructs, dispensing the text parsing needed
to comprehend source code.

<b>Fast prototyping</b> - models can be executed and validated from a high level of abstraction, at an early stage in the development process,  before much effort has to be spent. 

<b>Interoperability</b> - technical concerns are offloaded on the code generation infrastructure, that can produce end code for  different execution environments.

<b>Code quality</b> - model-to-code transformations produce uniform code and remove various sources of errors such as mistypings. 

<b>Productivity</b> - particularly in an industrial environment, a well matured MDD infrastructure can increase output.
