![Spatial](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Spatial.svg) 

This is essentially a stub for the
input of geo-referenced data. Each instance corresponds to a spatial layer
(either in raster or vector format) with the characteristic of having an
unequivocal value for each location in space. This stereotype also
provides means for the fully random generation of spatial variables,
that may be useful for prototyping with synthetic scenarios.

### Properties

* _inputFile_ - Path to a spatial layer initialising
    the _Spatial_ element. In case it is a vector layer, each feature
    generates a _Spatial_ instance; for raster layers each cell is 
    transformed into a _Spatial_ instance.

* _minValue_ - Minimum admissible value for the
    variable.

* _maxValue_ - Maximum admissible value for the
    variable.

* _stepVariation_ - Numerical value determining how the
    variable evolves with time. At each time step this value is summed to the
    _Spatial_ instance.

* _display_ - Boolean determining if the _Spatial_ variable is
    to be portrayed in the user interface. Since a _Spatial_ variable
    can cover the entire simulation space, not all may be
    displayed.

* _initValue_ - Numerical value that initiates the
    variable in all locations of the simulation space (alternative to
    _initRandom_ and _inputFile_).

* _initRandom_ - Boolean indicating if the variable
    is to be initiated with random values (alternative to _initValue_ and
    _inputFile_).

* _colourMin_ - RGB colour defining the lower end of the
    cloropleth used to portrait the variable.

* _colourMax_ - RGB colour defining the top end of the
    cloropleth used to portrait the variable.

### Artefacts

Elements of this type in the model produce a Java class with the same
name. This class extends the _MasonGeometry_ class from the GeoMASON
library and includes a property of type _MasonGeometry_. A 
_Portrayal_ class is also generated, with the same display functions as
in the _Animat_ case.
