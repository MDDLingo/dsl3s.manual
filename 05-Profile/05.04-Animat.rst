![Animat](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Animat.svg) 

This is the stereotype for the actors of change, it is intended to aggregate attributes and exist at a
perfectly identifiable location in space. The initial number of animat instances of each type, and their
spatial positioning, can be provided by a specific geo-referenced data set. Initial settings can also be randomly generated.

### Properties
* _inputFile_ - Path to a spatial layer containing
    features setting the initial number and location of animats. Attributes of 
    this layer can be used to initialise _Attributes_ owned by this
    _Animat_ element. Each feature in this spatial layer produces an
    singular _Animat_ instance.

* _initNum_ - The number of animats at simulation start.
    In case an input layer is not provided, this property is used to randomly cast animats
    in the simulation space.

* _wanderer_ - Determines whether the animat should move
    randomly in case no _Move_ stereotype is linked to it. Prevents an
    _Animat_ instance from standing idle in an optimal location.

* _colourMin_ - An RGB colour definition used to
    portrait the animat in the user interface. Defines a cloropleth together
    with _colourMax_, that is used in function of the values of one or
    more of the _Attribute_ elements owned.

* _colourMax_ - RGB colour defining the top end of the
    cloropleth used to portrait the _Animat_.



### Artefacts

For each Animat class in the model a Java class with the same name is generated.
It contains properties and methods to store and manage each of its
_Attribute_ elements, plus the MASON _step()_ routine, containing
the code to be executed at each simulation time step. A second Java class is also
generated, again with the _Animat_ name, but with the suffix _Portrayal_;
as its name implies, it defines a cloropleth and methods to display the Animat
in the GUI.
