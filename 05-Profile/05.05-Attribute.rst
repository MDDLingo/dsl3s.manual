![Attribute](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Attribute.svg) 

This stereotype represents a
single characteristic of an Animat, representable by an atomic data
type, such as an integer or a boolean. The values of Attribute elements can be
initialised through the same spatial data set initialising its owning Animat, using its attribute table.

### Properties

* _attribute_ - This property is used to
    initialise the _Attribute_ instance with the value of the
    corresponding value in the attribute table of the spatial layer assigned to
    the owning _Animat_ element. 

 * _minValue_ - Minimum admissible value of the _Attribute_.

* _maxValue_ - Maximum admissible value of the _Attribute_.

* _stepVariation_ - Numerical value determining how the
    _Attri\-bute_ evolves with time. At each time step this value is
    summed to the _Attribute_.

* _display_ - Boolean determining if the _Attribute_ is used
    to portrait the owning _Animat_.

* _initValue_ - Numerical value that initiates the
    _Attribute_ (alternative to _initRandom_ and
    _attribute_).

* _initRandom_ - Boolean indicating if the Attribute is to
    be initiated with a random value (alternative to _initValue_ and
    _attribute_).
    




### Artefacts

A single Java class named _Variable.class_ is generated, that serves as a
generic encapsulation for atomic values used in the simulation. This class
includes a set of properties (value, maximum, minimum and variation) and a set
of corresponding setter and getter methods. In the _Animat_ Java class, a
property of type _Variable_ is generated for each owned
_Attribute_ element; the _initValue_ and _initRandom_
properties are included as static Java properties in the _Sim.class_.
