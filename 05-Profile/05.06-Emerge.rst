![Emerge](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Emerge.svg) 

Defines
neighbourhood thresholds relative to spatial variables, or relative
to other animat attributes, above which the emergence of a new animat becomes
possible.
When a new animat is created, its initial state is set according to the
parameters set in the _Animat_ class itself.

### Properties

* _probability_ - Sets the probability of emergence of a new _Animat_ in
    presence of the associated _Attribute_ or _Spatial_ variable.

* _scope_ - Determines the radius of the neighbourhood to take
    into account in the emergence process.

* _required_ - Boolean that sets the presence of the associated
   	_Attribute_ or _Spatial_ variable as indispensable (or not)
   	for the emergence of a new _Animat_ instance.

* _lowerThreshold_ - Lower value of the interval within which the
   	associated _Attribute_ or _Spatial_ variable may trigger the emergence.

* _upperThreshold_ - Upper value of the interval within which the
   	associated _Attribute_ or _Spatial_ variable may trigger the emergence.

### Artefacts

For each _Animat_ in the model, a single Java class is produced, named
after the _Animat_ plus the suffix _Emerge_. The logic of every
_Emerge_ operation associated to the _Animat_ is collected here.
This Java class also has a _step()_ method that is executed at each time
step. It browses through the simulation space, at each location evaluating the
probability of emergence. The probabilities from each _Emerge_ element
are summed up, if the resulting value is above a random number generated between 
0 and 100, then emergence takes place.
