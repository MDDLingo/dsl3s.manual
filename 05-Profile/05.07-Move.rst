![Move](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Move.svg) 

Provides properties to weight the relevance
of each related class influencing the movement of an animat. For instance, in a
predator-prey simulation the movement of a "sheep" animat may be positively
weighted in relation to a "grass" _Spatial_ layer and negatively
weighted in relation to a "wolf" animat.

### Properties
* _weight_ - Numerical value determining the weight of the associated
    element (_Attribute_ or _Spatial_) in the movement process of the associated
    _Animat_.

* _scope_ - Sets the radius of the neighbourhood to scout.
    


### Artefacts


For each _Animat_ a method named _move()_ is generated containing the
logic of all _Move_ elements linked to it. This
method is included in the corresponding _Animat_ Java class and invoked in the
_step()_ method. At each time step the _move()_ method searches
for relevant instances within the neighbourhood(s) defined, collecting a set of
candidate locations. The _Animat_ moves into the location within the set
of candidates with highest weight.
