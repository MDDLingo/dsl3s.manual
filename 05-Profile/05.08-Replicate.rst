![Replicate](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Replicate.svg) 

provides properties to set replication
thresholds against the animat internal state. Impact on the reproducing animat
and inheritance of attribute values to the new animat can also be modelled with
specific properties. As with the _Emerge_ operation, the initial state of
a new animat resulting from a replication is set according to the properties
set in the _Animat_ class itself.

### Properties

* _lowerThreshold_ - Lower value of the interval within which the
   	associated _Attribute_ may trigger the replication process.

* _upperThreshold_ - Upper value of the interval within which the
   	associated _Attribute_ may trigger the replication process.

* _toll_ - Numerical value defining the impact of replication on the
   	associated _Attribute_ of the parent _Animat_.

* _inheritance_ - Numerical value defining the amount transmitted
   	to the associated _Attribute_ from the parent to the child _Animat_.



### Artefacts


For each Animat a method named _replicate()_ is generated containing the
logic of all _Replicate_ classes linked to the _Animat_ in the
model. This method is included in the corresponding _Animat_ Java class and
invoked in the _step()_ method.
