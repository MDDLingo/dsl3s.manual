![Harvest](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Harvest.svg) 

provides properties to para-metrise
changes to the harvesting _Animat_ in an interaction. This is modelled
with an harvest rate or harvest amount. A consumption rate of 100% may be used
to model preying relationships, whereas 0% can be used for the animat to simply
collect information on its neighbourhood.

### Properties

* _percentHarvested_ - Percentage of the harvested _Attribute_ or _Spatial_
   	variable to be taken (alternative to _valueHarvested_).

* _valueHarvested_ - Exact quantity of the harvested 
   	_Attribute_ or _Spatial_ variable
   	to be taken (alternative to _percentHarvested_).

* _maxIntake_ - Sets a limit to the amount harvested from the
   	associated _Attribute_ or _Spatial_.

* _scope_ - Sets the radius of the neighbourhood to take
   	into account in the harvest process.





### Artefacts

For each Animat a method named _harvest()_ is generated containing the
logic of all Harvest classes linked to the Animat in the model. It searches the
within the neighbourhood(s) defined for relevant instances, invoking their
harvest method counterparts as needed. This method is included in the
corresponding Animat Java class and invoked in the _step()_ method.
