![Perish](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/icons/Perish.svg) 

Defines an interval of values relative to
an _Attribute_ element, determining the conditions for the existence of
the _Animat_ itself.

### Properties

* _lowerThreshold_ - Lower threshold of the associated
  _Attribute_ below which instances of the associated _Animat_
  are discarded.

* _upperThreshold_ - Upper threshold of the associated
   	_Attri\-bute_ below which instances of the associated _Animat_
   	are discarded.






### Artefacts

For each _Animat_ Java class a method named _perish()_ is
generated containing the logic of all _Perish_ classes linked in
the model. It is invoked in the _step()_ method a tests all the
_Variable_ type properties of concerned _Attribute_ elements.
