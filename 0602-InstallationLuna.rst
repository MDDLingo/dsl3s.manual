### Pre-requisites

To follow this guide and use DSL3S, [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [Eclipse Luna](http://www.eclipse.org/luna/) must already be present in the system. Since these are relatively common software, their installation is considered to be beyond this guide.

The models generated with MDD3S have been successfully tested with Java versions 6, 7 and 8. Java 5 was never tested but is likely to also be functional. Programmes generated with MDD3S are not expected to run on Java versions 4 and earlier.

This installation guide is also available for [Eclipse Kepler](https://github.com/ldesousa/DSL3S/wiki/Installation).

### Acceleo and Papyrus plug-ins

In order to use Model Driven Development in Eclipse two specific plug-ins are required:

* [Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) - for graphical UML based modelling;

* [Acceleo](https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/) - for code generation from models.

These can be installed from the general update site for Eclipse Kepler:

1. Go to _Help_ -> _Install new software_  and select as update site "Luna - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna". If the Luna update site is not yet registered click _Add..._ and insert "Luna" for the name and the address above for _Location_; then click _OK_.

2. Expand the _Modelling_ item in the plug-in list and select _Acceleo_ and _Papyrus UML_. Click _Next_ and wait for the dependencies to be calculated. Go through the following menus and accept the Licences presented.

3. Restart Eclipse.

### DSL3S plug-ins

The DSL3S UML profile and the MDD3S code generator are available as plug-ins to Eclipse Luna. The install process is similar:

 1. Go to _Help_ -> _Install new software_  and click _Add..._. Insert "DSL3S" for _Name_ and the following address: http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/updates/4.4.luna/ for _Location_; then click _OK_. 

 2. Select _DSL3S_ and click _Next_ ; wait for the dependencies to be calculated and go on through the following menus accepting the Licence.

 3. Restart Eclipse.

### Software dependencies

The models generated with MDD3S depend on several libraries that must be present in the system:

* [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) - the multi-agent simulation toolkit.

* [GeoMASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/mason/extensions/geomason/) - an extension to MASON that bridges simulations with geo-spatial data.

* [Java Topology Suite](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm) - contains core geo-spatial data manipulation functionality required by GeoMASON. 

* [OpenCSV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/) - contains functionality to read CSV data into models.

For convenience, the JAR files for these libraries can be downloaded in a single archive from [here](http://ldesousa.github.io/DSL3S/dsl3s-dependencies.zip).

Unpack it to some handy place; In Debian based systems this can be _/usr/share/java_, but it can be somewhere else. To run programmes generated with MDD3S these libraries must be in the Java CLASSPATH.
