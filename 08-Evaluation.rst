The DSL3S is now undergoing an evaluation phase. Various demo sessions are being prepared were professionals in the fields of GIS, Computer Science and Environmental Sciences will use DSL3S for the first time to develop a sample application.

The user guide to be used in these sessions is available on-line, allowing anyone that wishes so to conduct this demo on their own: [DSL3S Simple Test guide](http://mddlingo.github.io/DSL3S/docs/DSL3S-2015-SimpleTest-User-Guide.pdf).

After completing the guide, participators are invited to fill in a short survey with their impressions on DSL3S: [DSL3S Questionnaire](http://goo.gl/forms/LQMClXU834).

In all it should not take much over 50 minutes. Thank you for participating!
